## [1.15.25] - 2025-06-09

### Fixed

- Improved logging and reset when SubWatcher sender fails to send submission due to file part missing error
- Set a cap on the upload queue, to avoid stale data when the media uploader is running slower than the data fetcher while the script is catching up a large backlog

## [1.15.24] - 2025-06-04

### Fixed

- If the media fetcher dies trying to upload a submission, re-fetch the data before trying to upload it again

## [1.15.23] - 2025-05-28

### Fixed

- If sending a submission from a new cache entry in subscription watcher, save that cache entry to the submission in the wait pool

## [1.15.22] - 2025-05-28

### Fixed

- If subscription sender receives FilePartMissingError from Telegram, reset the media reference and try upload again
- If the subscription sender has to re-try sending a submission, don't re-send it to places it was successfully sent

## [1.15.21] - 2025-05-08

### Fixed

- Fixed bug where subscription watcher would send 1 submission without progressing further
- Fixed import error

## [1.15.20] - 2025-05-08

### Changed

- When sender encounters an error, don't ignore it
- If sender received a FloodWaitError, wait before attempting new send

## [1.15.19] - 2025-04-22

### Fixed

- Fix circular import which caused startup failure

## [1.15.18] - 2025-04-22

### Fixed

- If a runnable task in the subscription watcher fails, allow it to revert the last attempt, before restarting

## [1.15.17] - 2025-04-17

### Changed

- If a runnable task in the subscription watcher fails, just restart and continue, rather than shutting down

## [1.15.16] - 2025-03-18

### Fixed

- If FA returns 524 error on download, retry the download
- Handle ClientOSError exceptions in media fetcher

## [1.15.15] - 2024-11-07

### Fixed

- Set a user agent when making requests to Weasyl

## [1.15.14] - 2024-07-03

### Added

- Handle fxraffinity.net links as if they're furaffinity.net ones

## [1.15.13] - 2023-12-14

### Fixed

- Handling http 522 status code when attempting to download media in the media fetcher, and retrying after a short wait

## [1.15.12] - 2023-09-22

### Fixed

- Media fetcher will now correctly handle http 520 and 403 responses from FA CDN
- Subscription watcher will now give up if it has been unsuccessful at fetching media for a submission over 100 times.
- Fixing a bodged refactor and putting the query parser back inside fa_search_bot

## [1.15.11] - 2023-09-08

### Fixed

- If subscription watcher gets 502 error while downloading media, backoff and try again

## [1.15.10] - 2023-09-03

### Fixed

- If a story submission lacks a preview image, try using the thumbnail image instead. This should avoid the subscription
  watcher ending up in a cycle passing a submission back and forth between data fetcher and media fetcher.

## [1.15.9] - 2023-08-31

### Changed

- Instead of skipping submissions when the media returns 404, the media fetcher will push them back to the data fetcher
  to fetch the data again, in case the submission's media URL has changed, rather than the submission being deleted.

## [1.15.8] - 2023-08-31

### Fixed

- Correctly handle 404 during submission upload in the subscription watcher

## [1.15.7] - 2023-08-31

### Changed

- Raise exception if unexpected status code received while downloading image. (May lower reliability until we find out
  where these exceptions get raised)

## [1.15.6] - 2023-08-24

### Changed

- Increase reliability of neaten functionality, by making it retry after cloudflare/slowdown errors a few times

## [1.15.5] - 2023-08-24

### Changed

- Detect 429 responses from FAExport, as well as 503 ones. Also use error_type for error identification

## [1.15.4] - 2023-08-16

### Changed

- If an image won't load, or save, in PIL, attempt to load it with the LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES flag set.

## [1.15.3] - 2023-07-27

### Changed

- Change `fasearchbot_fasubwatcher_latest_posted_at_unixtime` metric to record the FA posted timestamp of the last
  submission sent by the subscription Sender, rather than the last one whose data was fetched by the DataFetcher.
- MediaFetcher will attempt to re-upload to Telegram if it gets a ClientPayloadError during upload

## [1.15.2] - 2023-07-24

### Added

- Added the ability for the bot to lookup some submissions by filename, allowing automatically embedded FA gifs to be
  optimised, or downloaded e621 files to be looked up.

## [1.15.1] - 2023-07-21

### Fixed

- Fixed slow heartbeat from SubIDGatherer which was leading to excess alerts.
- Fixed race condition where submissions could be delivered to deleted subscriptions if they were still in the queue.

## [1.15.0] - 2023-07-19

### Changed

- Huge rewrite of the logic of the subscription watcher. Instead of doing everything sequentially, it now has a 4 part
  process of different tasks passing data across in queues. First task gathers new submission IDs, second task fetches
  the data for those IDs and checks subscriptions, third task downloads media and uploads to telegram, fourth task sends
  telegram messages. The fourth task always ensures messages are sent to telegram in the order they are published to FA,
  while allowing the second and third tasks to be scaled out to run in parallel to multiple copies of eachother. This
  should improve throughput a fair bit!
- FAExportAPI web requests are all async now, rather than blocking.
- Metrics will have changed a lot in the fasearchbot_fasubwatcher_* area.
- Four heartbeats, one for each task.
- If a submission fails to process, the subscription watcher shuts down rather than skipping one. Hopefully it shouldn't
  fail to process!

## [1.14.1] - 2023-07-06

### Changed

- If FA browse page is unavailable for the subscription watcher (such as during cloudflare protection), try using the
  home page, as we only want the latest submission ID anyway.

## [1.14.0] - 2023-06-08

### Added

- Added support for neatening and embedding Weasyl submission links

### Fixed

- Correctly record metrics for how long it takes to upload audio and image submissions, rather than just videos

## [1.13.9] - 2023-05-15

### Fixed

- Correctly handling submission links which have been deleted from e621
- Removed call to `str.removeprefix()` which caused issues with older python versions

## [1.13.8] - 2023-05-15

### Fixed

- Fixed two pass video conversion

### Added

- Added thumbnails to sent videos

## [1.13.7] - 2023-05-14

### Fixed

- Fixed bug where inline search might report no results exist at the end of a search
- Fixed bug where submissions sent by fallback methods would be cached
- Only download images once when sending them, hopefully speeding things up

### Changed

- Setting better filenames on videos and gifs (with site and submission ID)
- Setting title and performer on audio files sent by the bot
- Separating the methods for uploading media to telegram and sending it as a message, allowing future performance
  improvements

## [1.13.6] - 2023-05-06

### Fixed

- Fixed bug where gifs could not be sent via inline neatening. (Fixes sending audio and pdf also)

### Changed

- When sending submissions that have already been cached as full results, inline result will be sent correctly first
  time, rather than having an optimise button and calling inline edit.

## [1.13.5] - 2023-04-28

### Added

- Added metrics on time taken by various steps of sending a fresh message, `fasearchbot_sendable_time_taken`

## [1.13.4] - 2023-04-27

### Added

- Added metrics on cache database size, `fasearchbot_db_cache_entries`
- Added metrics on saving and loading cache, cache hits and misses, to submission cache, `fasearchbot_submissioncache_*`
- Added metrics on inline query result counts, cached and fresh, `fasearchbot_inline_*_results_count`

## [1.13.3] - 2023-04-27

### Fixed

- Improved reliability of inline search, returning smaller batches of fresh results for speed, but sending larger 
  batches of cached results if available.

## [1.13.2] - 2023-04-24

### Added

- Added new metric, `fasearchbot_sentsubmission_sent_from_cache_total` storing how many messages are sent from cache.

### Fixed

- Subscription watcher to handle PeerIdInvalidError by pausing all subscriptions to that peer.

## [1.13.1] - 2023-04-24

### Fixed

- Subscription watcher will now send from cache correctly

## [1.13.0] - 2023-04-24

### Added

- Added a cache database that stores the file ID of all images sent in telegram, so that they can be sent much faster 
  the second time. This also came with a big refactor of the internals and site handling and such. Should make inline
  queries more reliable too! (By virtue of being faster)

## [1.12.6] - 2023-04-20

### Added

- Added a prometheus metric `fasearchbot_fasubwatcher_time_taken`, which is logging the time taken by the subscription 
  watcher performing various tasks. This merges the metric series which were added in version 1.12.5.

### Removed

- Removed the older metric series of the form `fasearchbot_fasubwatcher_time_taken_*`, to merge them all into one metric
  series with individual labels for different tasks

## [1.12.5] - 2023-04-18

### Added

- Added a series of prometheus metrics to the subscription watcher, logging the time taken by various stages of the
  subscription watcher's process. These are all of the form `fasearchbot_fasubwatcher_time_taken_*`

## [1.12.4] - 2023-04-04

### Added

- Added a prometheus metric `fasearchbot_fasubwatcher_latest_posted_at_unixtime`, which is the unix timestamp that the 
  latest processed submission was uploaded to FA

### Removed

- Removed the `fasearchbot_fasubwatcher_backlog_seconds` metric, which may become outdated or misleading

## [1.12.3] - 2023-04-04

### Added

- Added a prometheus metric `fasearchbot_fasubwatcher_backlog_seconds`, which says how many seconds old the latest 
  submission checked by the subscription watcher is. (i.e. how many seconds since it was posted on FA)

## [1.12.2] - 2022-11-24

### Added

- Added a prometheus metric `fasearchbot_fasubwatcher_subscription_destination_count_active`, which says how many
  destinations have at least one active subscription

## [1.12.1] - 2022-11-24

### Fixed

- Subscriptions will now be paused when the bot cannot access a channel

### Changed

- Renamed `fasearchbot_fasubwatcher_updates_failed` metric to `fasearchbot_fasubwatcher_updates_failed_total`

### Fixed

- Fixing `fasearchbot_faapi_cloudflare_errors_total` metric, which had incorrect label naming

## [1.11.3] - 2021-08-18

### Added
